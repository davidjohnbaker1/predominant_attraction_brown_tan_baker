* Reviewer 1 

** IN-PROGRESS p7: Edit Sentence to:
   - "In describing the succession of chords and chord functions, many textbook authors take the position that
     our understanding of chord syntax can be understood by looking at the statistical regularities that chords
     occur"

** DONE p10: Edit sentence to:
   - "In each trial of the experiment, participants heard four chords. The first chord was always 
     C in order to establish tonic. The last two chords were always V followed by I to signify 
      cadenital closure. The second chord in each trial was the target chord that changed with each
     trial and could have been one of the 31 different pre-dominant harmonies in our study"
   - We agree the sentence is not clear and have re-written it for clarity. We considered adding in 
     another figure, but thought this would be too many figures.
     

** IN-PROGRESS p11: ADD sentence after:
   - This ranked ordering reflects the degree to which each chord category would be theorized to 
     be be pre-dominant according to the literature and gives a falsifiable framework to test.

** DONE p16: CHANGE
   - change to Methods

** TODO p17-18 CHANGE
   - All read as Sound 1 

** DONE p19: ADD
   - Our first reseach question sought to model mean group differences between each of the four proposed chord
     categories from the literature. Our second research question extends our first to investigate the effect
     of music theory training on ratings, and the third looks to model how a chord's features are 
     predictive of lister's ratings of attraction.

** DONE p20: CHANGE
   - Changed to regression coefs

** TODO Model Reporting
   - ??? Check with JB and DT on adding this to manuscript

** TODO Figure 2B: Reject for Music Perception Standards and $$

** TODO ADD
   - Sentence: The separation here probably is due to the features space of what is added??


* Reviewer 2 

** DONE Page 4-5: ADD Suggestions
   - Yes, CW, agree with this

   - See above, same

** DONE Page 4: EDIT clarity of Scale Degree argument 
  
** DONE 6-7 CHANGE "Theory" --> "New title"

** TODO Page 10

** TODO Page 12
   - DJB: Ask JB + DT on thought

   - APA standards asks for this ??
   - Feel like might be helpful for people doing research on gendered rep in empirical work 

** TODO p22: ADD
   - "[sentence here on 3a]"

** TODO p22: CHANGED to Normalized, added linkage, analyses in OSF
   - Also, of course?

** DONE p24: would get caught in copyediting

** TODO p27: REWRITE
   - "In our final analysis, we reconsidered chord categories adopted by music theory textbooks"

** Todo Implications
   - DJB: Check with co-authors on implicaitons re-write 


* DJB To Dos

** TODO ADD in easier words in Results for Dom 
** TODO ADD Color to Figure 2B
