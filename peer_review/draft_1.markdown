# Draft One Reading Notes

* Chromatic > diatonic statistic is fragile

# Chris Notes 

## Pre-domiant definition

* reviewers opinion that pre-dominant came from his alma mater, but not offered
* agree that it is not well defined term 
* Jut get aroun issue by saying

> Issue is difficult, but we mean kostka payne. Regardelss, in ecological context
> in THIS experiment it means before the domiant

* [ ] we do this in final anlaysis to make pile of chords
* [ ] Reject idea of unsupervised machine learning approach due to contraint of feature space in experiment

* how many categories they should be, maybe 

Just re-do intro to say it's difficult.
Not about to pre-suppose, but we do know that X defines it as this 
Will take feature based analysis, but limiting due to problems with constraints of experiment design

## Experimental choices motivated

* agree on better motivation for modeling, but have new analysis thanks to other reviewer
* Getting pedantic with the stimuli given what statistical power of this design would offer
* Agree with some aspects of having weighted category
* But remind that only matters that residuals are normall distibuted
* Imagine binary variable with SIMULATION 

* did not want to get wrapped up in post hoc, familywise rror
* Decide to opt to model the data by just using parameter estimation
* just fit maximal model assumed to fit data

* as for bodily experience, remember statistical model is small world of larger world (mcelreath) 

## Divide into two experiments 

* agree with cultural factors should rather be reworded as learning
* just redid analyses and pared down claims 

## Cultural situatedness of experiemnt
